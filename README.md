   - Estate Grant: Assists in handling grants related to the distribution of a worker's estate posthumously.
   - Hajj Grant: Manages claims for financial support for workers intending to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.
   - Educational Grant: Facilitates the disbursement of grants for the education of workers' children.
